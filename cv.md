## About me:

Hi, I'm a Junior Front-end Developer and love writing code. Last year I worked as a website developer (layout +React js) at a video advertising service startup in my city. At the moment I would love to work for a large company with interesting projects. I'm a fast learner and enjoy solving tasks of different complexity.

Till now I have been engaged in the promotion of sites in search networks, layout, and content of sites. My previous experience helps me to write code more efficiently now.
